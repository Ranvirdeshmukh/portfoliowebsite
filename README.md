# Title - Ranvir's Portfolio Website

*description*
This is my portfolio wesbite and I have taken inspiration from a bunch of website like strangeworks.com, a page on landing folio, college pulse. A major source of inspiration
for my website was the following : https://jasonbriscoe.com/?ref=landingfolio

## What Worked Well
For me , I think everything in part-1 went well and I am extremely happy to take this class.

# Extra credit
I have done the extra credit by adding a CSS animation to my page of the typewriter's effect. It usually requires
javascript to enable to the typing effect but i watched some youtube video to mae it work with just CSS. Also, i added animation to of my image sliding in the screen on about page. Also, added a alot of interesting features for the shadow effect on the blocks.
